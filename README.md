Python Graph Analysis Project
• Developed a Python program to parse character interaction data from Homer’s Illiad and represent it as an undirected graph.
•	Implemented a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore the graph, ensuring nodes were visited in alphabetical order.
•	Utilized DFS to identify connected components in the graph, iterating over unvisited nodes and running DFS from each to discover connected nodes.
• Analyzed the dataset to figure out the complex relationship between the characters from Illiad to better understand and formulate the text
